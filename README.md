# Next Steps

Reaching out to non-profits in the area to get more information and start creating traffic through page-links, social outreach, etc.

Look into extra security for site as to keep out bully's and unwanted users from the site, keep user information very secure, I wouldn't want to jeopardize anybody's information let alone that of individuals who are having mental health issues. 

Connect the site to twitter and give users the option to post directly to twitter when they would like their blog posts to be shared further. 

Make it possible for users to upload photos for their profile or blog posts with instagram, flickr, drag and drop from their computer, etc.
